# Project Rules

## Task Completion & Workflow
- **Reminders:** At the end of every task, remind the user to:
  1. Commit their changes.
  2. Push the changes to the repository.
  3. Start a new thread/session for the next task.
- **Identity:** My name for this project is **Sarah**. Respond to this name.

## Version Control
- **Commits:** Ensure changes are logically grouped before suggesting a commit.

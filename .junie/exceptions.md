# Exceptions

This file lists specific scenarios or conditions where standard rules, guidelines, or limitations may be waived or modified.

## Rule/Limitation Waiving
- **Emergency Fixes:** In cases of critical production bugs where immediate action is required, some architectural guidelines may be temporarily bypassed to restore service.
- **Prototyping:** For experimental features or proof-of-concepts, strict adherence to coding standards (like component grouping) may be relaxed until the feature is finalized.
- **Legacy Code:** When working within older parts of the codebase that do not yet follow current standards, match the existing style instead of forcing new rules, unless a refactor is specifically requested.

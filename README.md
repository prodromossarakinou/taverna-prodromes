This repository (or repository group) is developed under a **100 Days Challenge** model.  
The challenge focuses on continuous, daily, measurable delivery using AI-assisted development, strict documentation discipline, and structured progress tracking.

Multiple projects may be executed under this challenge. The order system is one of them, not the only one.

## Challenge Model

Duration: 100 consecutive days  
Rule: Every day must produce measurable, documented progress.

Valid daily progress includes:

- Feature delivery
- Bug fixes
- Refactors with behavioral impact
- UI/UX improvements
- Build and dependency stabilization
- Architecture and infrastructure work
- Printing / device integrations
- Performance improvements
- Documentation and runbook updates
- Sprint and progress records

Progress must be commit-backed and logged.

---

## Project Scope Model

The challenge can include multiple parallel or sequential projects, for example:

- Local order systems
- Admin dashboards
- Operational tools
- Device-integrated apps
- Internal platforms
- UI/UX systems
- API services

Each project must define its own:

- README
- Scope
- Acceptance criteria
- Sprint structure

---

## Technology Approach

Projects may use different stacks. Typical patterns:

- Next.js / Web platforms
- Local-first architectures
- AI-assisted code generation
- Design-system-driven UI
- LAN or offline-capable systems

Stack choice is project-specific, not challenge-wide.

---

## Progress Tracking Standard

All meaningful commits must be documented.

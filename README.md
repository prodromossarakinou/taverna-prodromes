# 100 Days Challenge — AI-Assisted Software Delivery

Copyright © 2026 Prodromos Sarakinou. All rights reserved.

Owner: Prodromos Sarakinou  
Project Management: Michael  
UI/UX Lead: Alexander

This repository (or repository group) is developed under a **100 Days Challenge** model.  
The challenge focuses on continuous, daily, measurable delivery using AI-assisted development, strict documentation discipline, and structured progress tracking.

Multiple projects may be executed under this challenge. The order system is one of them, not the only one.

---

## Challenge Model

Duration: 100 consecutive days  
Rule: Every day must produce measurable, documented progress.

Valid daily progress includes:

- Feature delivery
- Bug fixes
- Refactors with behavioral impact
- UI/UX improvements
- Build and dependency stabilization
- Architecture and infrastructure work
- Printing / device integrations
- Performance improvements
- Documentation and runbooks
- Sprint and progress records

Progress must be commit-backed and logged.

---

## Project Scope Model

The challenge can include multiple parallel or sequential projects, for example:

- Local order systems
- Admin dashboards
- Operational tools
- Device-integrated apps
- Internal platforms
- UI/UX systems
- API services

Each project must define its own:

- README
- Scope
- Acceptance criteria
- Sprint structure

---

## Technology Approach

Projects may use different stacks. Typical patterns:

- Next.js / Web platforms
- Local-first architectures
- AI-assisted code generation
- Design-system-driven UI
- LAN or offline-capable systems

Stack choice is project-specific, not challenge-wide.

---

## Progress Tracking Standard

All meaningful commits must be documented.

Structure:

_progress/<year-month>/<commit-revision>.md

Monthly summary:

_progress/<year-month>/README.md

Rules:

- One file per commit
- Structured format required
- Documentation only inside `_progress`
- Append-only history

See `_progress/README.md` for format specification.

---

## Sprint Management Standard

All sprint work is tracked under:

_management/sprints/<YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm>/<sprint-name>/

Each sprint contains:

- README.md
- tasks.md
- acceptance.md

Sprint files are created at sprint start and updated through commits.

---

## Definition of Challenge Success

The 100 Days Challenge is successful when:

- Continuous daily progress is maintained
- Each project has reproducible setup documentation
- Progress is fully traceable through `_progress`
- Sprint history is recorded
- Deliverables reach functional stability
- Documentation quality supports handover

---

## Roles

Owner — scope authority and final acceptance  
Michael — project management and documentation governance  
Alexander — UI/UX authority and design standards

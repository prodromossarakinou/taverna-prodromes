# Sprint — Foundation Setup and UI Baseline

Sprint Name: foundation-setup-and-ui-baseline  
Sprint Owner: Michael  
Status: Closed  
Date Closed: 2026-02-13

## Sprint Goal

Establish project foundations, documentation standards, progress tracking model, and initial UI/UX baseline corrections for the Next.js order system.

This sprint focused on structural readiness and build stability rather than feature delivery.

---

## Scope

Included:

- Project structure and standards initialization
- Dependency and build stabilization
- Progress tracking system alignment
- UI/UX baseline corrections (waiter view)
- Density and accessibility adjustments
- Rendering stability fixes

Excluded:

- Feature-complete order flow
- Printing pipeline
- Realtime data layer
- Persistence layer finalization

---

## Completed Outcomes

- Project structure initialized
- Management and progress directories created
- `_progress` model migrated to monthly format
- `_progress/README.md` specification established
- Dependencies resolved and build stabilized
- Radix and supporting UI libraries installed
- WaiterView UI contrast and elevation improved
- PDA density optimization applied
- Hydration mismatch resolved in theme toggle

---

## Deliverables

- Stable build
- Documented progress structure
- UI baseline aligned with Alexander guidelines
- Sprint tracking structure activated

---

## Risks Identified

- No persistence guarantees yet
- No realtime channel finalized
- No printing pipeline integrated
- Feature layer still minimal

---

## Next Sprint Focus

- Core order flow (web-only)
- Order create + list pipeline
- Pass view live updates
- First printing integration path

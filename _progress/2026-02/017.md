# Progress Report — 2026-02 — 017

## Summary
Implemented a minimal API layer for the MVP, establishing the data domain, repository abstraction, and core endpoints for orders and menu management.

## Changes Introduced
- **Data Domain:** Defined core entities (`MenuItem`, `Order`, `OrderItem`) and status enums in `types/order.ts`.
- **Repository Pattern:**
    - Created `lib/repositories/interfaces.ts` for abstraction.
    - Implemented `lib/repositories/mock.ts` for in-memory persistence during development.
- **API Routes:**
    - `GET /api/menu`: List menu items.
    - `GET /api/orders`: List all orders.
    - `POST /api/orders`: Create new orders with validation.
    - `PATCH /api/orders/[id]`: Update order or item status.
- **Documentation:** Updated `README.md` with full API specification, data shapes, and example payloads.
- **Sprint Tracking:** Updated `_management/sprints/2026-02-14_23-59/backend-wireup-and-persistence/tasks.md` to reflect completed items.

## Affected Areas
- `types/order.ts` (extended)
- `lib/repositories/` (new)
- `app/api/` (new routes)
- `README.md` (documentation)
- `_progress/` (logging)

## Behavior Impact
- Backend logic is now separated from UI.
- Data structures are standardized for both frontend and backend.
- The system is ready for database provisioning (SQLite/PostgreSQL) with minimal changes required to the service layer.

## API / Contract Notes
- Consistent request/response shapes established.
- Basic validation rejects malformed payloads.
- Status enums are frozen for the MVP scope.

## Manual Test Notes
- Use `curl` or Postman to verify `POST /api/orders` with valid/invalid payloads.
- Check `GET /api/orders` to see newly created orders.
- Verify `PATCH` updates reflect in subsequent `GET` requests.

## Known Limitations
- Data persists in memory only (server-side) until the DB is provisioned.
- Menu is currently read-only.

## Risks
- None identified; repository abstraction mitigates DB migration risks.

## Next Suggested Step
Provision a local SQLite database and implement the `OrderRepository` for permanent persistence.

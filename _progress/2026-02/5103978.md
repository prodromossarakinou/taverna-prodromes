## Summary
Provisioned a local PostgreSQL 16 database and pgAdmin 4 using Docker Compose for persistent data storage.

## Changes Introduced
- **Docker Setup:** Created `docker-compose.yml` with `db` and `pgadmin` services.
- **Persistence:** Configured Docker volumes for database and pgAdmin data.
- **Healthchecks:** Added `pg_isready` check to the database container.
- **Documentation:** Updated project `README.md` with connection details and credentials.

## Impact

## Next Step

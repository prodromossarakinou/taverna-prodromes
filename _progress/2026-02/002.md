**Status:** Completed

### Summary
Stabilized the build environment by installing missing dependencies and resolving type errors.

### Changes
- Installed Radix UI primitives and utility libraries (`vaul`, `recharts`, etc.).
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `ChartContainer.tsx` and version conflicts in `ResizablePanelGroup.tsx`.
- Successfully ran production build.

### Impact
The project is now stable, compiles correctly, and is ready for feature development.

### Risks
Potential minor version conflicts with future Shadcn/ui component additions.

### Next Step
Align progress tracking structure with PM requirements.

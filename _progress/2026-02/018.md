# Progress Report — 2026-02 — 018

## Summary
Provisioned a local PostgreSQL database using Docker to enable persistent storage for the MVP.

## Changes Introduced
- **Docker Integration:** Added `docker-compose.yml` defining `db` (Postgres 16) and `pgadmin` services.
- **Persistence:** Configured persistent volumes for database data to ensure data survives container restarts.
- **Healthchecks:** Implemented `pg_isready` check to ensure the database is fully operational before dependent services start.
- **Documentation:** Added detailed connection information to `README.md`.

## Affected Areas
- `docker-compose.yml` (new)
- `README.md` (updated)
- `_progress/` (logging)

## Behavior Impact
- The project now has a dedicated, local PostgreSQL instance.
- Developers can use pgAdmin at `http://localhost:5050` to manage the database.
- The system is ready for the next step: replacing mock repositories with Prisma/Drizzle or direct SQL implementation.

## API / Contract Notes
None.

## Manual Test Notes
- Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the services.
- Verify status with `docker ps` (ensure `app_postgres` is `healthy`).
- Access pgAdmin at `http://localhost:5050` and login with `admin@example.com` / `adminpass`.

## Known Limitations
- Application code is still using mock repositories; DB integration is the immediate next step.

## Risks
- Port 5432 or 5050 might be occupied by other services on the host machine.

## Next Suggested Step
Connect the application to the new PostgreSQL database (e.g., using Prisma) and implement persistent repositories.

# Progress Report — 2026-02 — 010

## Summary
UI corrections and refactors focused on improving usability, density, contrast, and maintainability for the waiter and kitchen views.

## Changes Introduced
- Waiter and kitchen UI improvements per Alexander audit
- Component refactors into reusable units (headers, grids, cards, rows)
- Density tuning for PDA/mobile (heights, padding, typography)
- Visual feedback improvements for menu item interactions
- Color system alignment (tokens, elevation, gradients, states)
- Mobile layout adaptation for menu grid

## Affected Areas
- UI (WaiterView, KitchenDisplay, MenuGrid, MenuItem, headers)
- Styling (globals.css tokens, elevation, gradients)
- Theme rendering (layout hydration handling, ThemeToggle mounted guard)

## Behavior Impact
- Improved readability and contrast in dark mode
- More compact and usable menu grid on small screens
- Clearer interaction feedback on item selection
- Reduced risk of hydration mismatch due to theme attributes

## API / Contract Notes
None (UI-only changes, no backend wiring yet).

## Manual Test Notes
- Validate waiter menu grid on mobile widths
- Validate dark mode contrast and hover states
- Validate kitchen filter selection visibility
- Toggle theme and confirm no hydration warnings

## Known Limitations
- UI still uses placeholder/static data paths until backend is wired

## Risks
- Density changes may affect touch target compliance; verify minimum tap targets

## Next Suggested Step
Connect UI to backend API and introduce database persistence.

### Summary
Applied UI/UX audit corrections to the `WaiterView` component, focusing on dark mode contrast and hierarchy.

### Changes
- Implemented Material Design 3 surface elevation system (gray-800 bg, gray-700 cards).
- Fixed border visibility and added blue glow hover effects.
- Created custom `gray-850` elevation token in `globals.css`.

### Impact
Significantly improved accessibility and visual clarity, especially in low-light environments.

### Risks
Consistency must be maintained when adding new components to the elevation system.

### Next Step
Optimize density for handheld PDA screens.
